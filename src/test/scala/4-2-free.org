/Free Monad/ means you can get a **free** monad from any =Functor=

** Free Structure
A Free Structure is basically very similar to =Cons= and =Nil= of
=List=, we call such similarity /Isomorphic/

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  seal trait Free[S[_], A]
  final case class Pure[S[_], A](a: A) extends Free[S, A]
  final case class Suspend[S[_], A](a: S[A]) extends Free[S, A]
#+END_SRC

=Pure= is like =Nil= representing the end of structure, and =Suspend=
to =Cons= means there is something else left behind.

To make it a Monad, which could be something like
#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  implicit def catsFreeMonadForFree[S[_]](implicit F:Functor[S]): Monad[Free[S, ?]] =
    new Monad[Free[S, ?]] {
      def pure[A](a: A): Free[S, A] = Pure(a)
      def map[A, B](fa: Free[S, A])(f: A => B): Free[S, B] = fa.flatMap(a=>Pure(f(a)))
      def flatMap[A, B](a: Free[S, A])(f: A => Free[S, B]): Free[S, B] = a match {
        case Pure(a) => f(a)
        case Suspend(a) => Suspend(F.map(a)(next=>next.flatMap(f)))
      }
    }
#+END_SRC

while you probably noticed that we need =S= to be a =Functor= first, so that we can
=map= it's next step and continuous =flatMap=

** CoYoneda Lemma (Trick)
The problem becomes "how can we get a free functor from any =S[_]=?" then

This is when we need to introduce /CoYoneda Lemma/:

A =CoYoneda[F[_], A]= consists of two things

- a function =B => A=
- a =F[B]=

Since =B= can share the same polymorphism of =A= and =F=, they are in the same rank[fn:1], so we
can simply add =B= into the type parameter of =CoYoneda= as well, thus it becomes =CoYoneda[F[_], A, B]=,
which we could simply represent it as scala case class:

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
    case class CoYoneda[F[_], A, B](fb: F[B], f: B => A)
#+END_SRC

And define a functor over CoYoneda is very straightforward:
#+BEGIN_SRC scala :tangle no :exports code
  implicit def functorForCoyoneda = new Functor[CoYoneda[F, ?, B]] {
    def map[A, C](fa:CoYoneda[F, A, B])(f: A=>C): CoYoneda[F, C, B] {
      CoYoneda(fa.fb, (f compose fa.f)) // (f compose fa.f) has type B => C
    }
  }
#+END_SRC

It's actully very similar to /Continuation Passing Style/, which just continous composing function
=f= to the function inside CoYoneda.

Now we know how to map over a =CoYoneda=, but how can we get a =CoYoneda=
from any =F[_]=?

/CoYoneda Lemma/ (Trick)

The trick is to use the magical =identity= function ~A=>A~, then we'll get a =CoYoneda[F, A, A]= from any =F[_]=
, and eventually, =F[_]= become a Functor because any =CoYoneda= is Functor.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  def lift[F[_], A](fa: F[A]):CoYoneda[F, A, A] =
    CoYoneda(fa, identity:A=>A)
#+END_SRC

To construct a Free Monad, we can use the CoYoneda Trick to lift any =F[_]=, and put the CoYoneda to Free.

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
  def liftF[F[_], A](value: F[A]): Free[F, A] = Suspend(lift(value))
#+END_SRC

** Effects
Let's forget about CoYoneda[fn:2] for now, I'm gonna show you how easy to use cat's Free[fn:5] to free your ADT and get a free program
then, separate your effect from the core business logic.

Imagine we have a document database to query, it's easy to abstract 3 method on it:

- =get(key: String)=
- =put(key: String, value: String)=
- =delete(key: String)=

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
object Database {
  def get(key: String): String = {
    println("querying database")
    s"value for key $key"
  }

  def put(key: String, value: String) ={
    println(s"saving $key to database")
  }

  def delete(key: String) = {
    println(s"deleteing $key")
  }
}
#+END_SRC

All of these actions are actually effects, because they will potentially cause some state changes outside the scope where the method is executed.

While testing those methods could be a nightmare as well, you have to either setup a real database or mock these methods' implementation

#+BEGIN_SRC scala :tangle yes :exports none
behavior of "program"
it should "hard to unit test get put delete" in {
  program() shouldBe (())
}
#+END_SRC

You will find it's too hard to mock a =object=, so the test could end up with a integration test which require real database, or refactor =Database= to a normal class so you can mock it properly.

It's hard to test because:
- imperative: when you call the method, the effect actually happen
- stateful: the effect and result depends on database, which is out of the scope of =Database=

To make your program more declarative and testable, we can describe all database interactions using ADT

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
sealed trait DbEff[A]
case class Put(key: String, value: String) extends DbEff[Unit]
case class Get(key: String) extends DbEff[String]
case class Delete(key: String) extends DbEff[Unit]
#+END_SRC

All these ADTs is just describing what kind of behavior a database can provide, and what value they should return.

no database interaction will actually happen when you construct those ADTs

** Free your program

to lift those ADTs into Free, simply using =liftF= [fn:4] we've introduced in [[*CoYoneda Lemma (Trick)]]

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
object DbEff {
  def get(key: String): Free[DbEff, String] = Free.liftF[DbEff, String](Get(key))
  def put(key: String, v: String): Free[DbEff, Unit] = ???
  def delete(key: String): Free[DbEff, Unit] = ???
}
#+END_SRC

=put= and =delete= should be pretty much the same

to lift your =program= defined before to free, the simplest trick is to change all ~=~ to =<-= and remove =val=

#+BEGIN_SRC scala
object program {                         object freeProgram {
  def apply() = {                          val oldKey = "123"
    val oldKey = "123"                     def apply() = for {
    val oldVal = Database.get(oldKey)        oldVal <- DbEff.get(oldKey)
    val newVal = s"this is new: $oldVal"     newVal = s"this is new: $oldVal"
    val newKey = oldKey.reverse              newKey = oldKey.reverse
    Database.put(newKey, newVal)             _ <- DbEff.put(newKey, newVal)
    Database.delete(oldKey)                  _ <- DbEff.delete(oldKey)
  }                                        } yield ()
}                                        }
#+END_SRC

Just like that, every thing just lifted in to Free, instead of actually querying the database.

** Interpret your program

Since our program is organized, we can define an interpreter just for test, without actually talk to database, but
simulating the interactions between your program and database. [fn:3]

#+BEGIN_SRC scala :tangle yes :exports none
object DbEffInterp {
  val fake = Lambda[DbEff ~> IO](_ match {
    case Get("123")    => IO(s"value for key 123")
    case Put("321", v) => IO(println(s"saving 123 to database"))
    case Delete("123") => IO(println(s"deleteing 123"))
    case a => IO(fail(s"unexpecting interaction: $a"))
  })
}
#+END_SRC

So, if you =foldMap= your program over the interpreter

#+BEGIN_SRC scala :tangle yes :exports none
  behavior of "free program"
  it should "run on fake interpreter to verify your program logic" in {
    (freeProgram() foldMap DbEffInterp.fake) unsafeRunSync () shouldBe (())
  }
#+END_SRC

A nice message will tell you when =sbt "testOnly *Free"=

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
[info] - should run on fake interpreter to verify your program logic *** FAILED ***
[info]   unexpecting interaction: Delete(321) (4-2-free.scala:17)
#+END_EXAMPLE

You'll know what to fix, seems we have some business bug in =freeProgram=

** TODO What really happened here

* Footnotes

[fn:5] Free Monad from cats already embedded CoYoneda trick in it's implementation, namely =Flatmaped=.

[fn:4] here we're using cats free implementation, which already have CoYoneda embedded in =Free= implementation, so we don't need to =lift= the value to =CoYoneda= our self.

[fn:3] remember the =Lambda= trick from [[file:4-1-kind.org::*Kind Projector]] ?

[fn:2] it's totally fine if you didn't follow, you don't actually need to understand how Free is implemented to use it.

[fn:1] hope you still remember what "rank" is from 4-1-kind
